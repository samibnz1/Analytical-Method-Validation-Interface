# Automated Analytical Method Validation Interface

## Introduction
This project is a Python script designed to validate an analysis method using various statistical criteria. It performs tests on the provided data and generates detailed reports in Word format. The validation criteria include:

- **Linearity**: Validates the linear relationship between variables.
- **Accuracy**: Validates the method's precision against reference values.
- **Repeatability**: Validates the consistency and variability of measurements.
- **Robustness**: Validates the stability of the method using a Hadamard matrix.
- **Exactness**: Validates the method according to specified levels and tolerance limits.
- **LOD/LOQ**: Calculates the Limits of Detection and Quantification.

## Excel Files and Data Structure
The project requires several Excel files to validate the analysis method according to different criteria. Below is a guide to properly structure your Excel files:

### 1. Linearity Validation
- **Table for Active Ingredient (PA) only**: Contains data to validate linearity with the active ingredient alone.
- **Table for PA + FPR**: Contains data to validate linearity with the active ingredient and the reconstituted dosage form (FPR).

**Expected Structure for Each Linearity File:**

| Factor  | x (independent variable) | y (response) |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Level 1 | 10                       | 12           |
| Level 2 | 20                       | 25           |
| Level 3 | 30                       | 35           |

### 2. Accuracy Validation
The Excel file for accuracy contains data for PA + FPR.

**Expected Structure for the Accuracy File:**

| Level | xij | yij  | Reference |
|-------|-----|------|-----------|
| 1     | 10  | 9.8  | 10        |
| 2     | 20  | 19.5 | 20        |
| 3     | 30  | 29.2 | 30        |

### 3. Repeatability Validation
The Excel file for repeatability contains data for variability and repeatability between series.

**Expected Structure for the Repeatability File:**

| Series | Trial | Quantity Introduced | Air | Response |
|--------|-------|---------------------|-----|----------|
| 1      | 1     | 5                   | 2.1 | 5.2      |
| 1      | 2     | 5                   | 2.3 | 5.3      |
| 2      | 1     | 10                  | 3.0 | 10.1     |

> **Important**: For accuracy and repeatability validation, the "Day Constants" represent a calibration factor for each testing day. These constants are obtained by dividing the measured response (`yij`) by the introduced quantity (`xij`) for each repetition on the respective day:
> - **Day Constant 1**: Calculated as the ratio of `yij` to `xij` for day 1.
> - **Day Constant 2**: Similarly calculated for day 2.
> - **Day Constant 3**: Similarly calculated for day 3.  
> These constants adjust measurements based on specific experimental conditions for each testing day.

### 4. Robustness Validation
The files for robustness contain a Hadamard matrix with the responses in the last column.

**Expected Structure for the Robustness File:**

| x1 | x2 | Response |
|----|----|----------|
| 1  | 0  | 10       |
| 0  | 1  | 12       |
| 1  | 1  | 11       |

### 5. Exactitude Profile
For exactness, you need to choose the number of levels and then import tables based on the specified number of levels. For each level, you must enter a reference value.

**Expected Structure for the Exactness Files:**

| Level | xij | yij  | Reference |
|-------|-----|------|-----------|
| 1     | 10  | 9.8  | 10        |
| 2     | 20  | 19.5 | 20        |
| 3     | 30  | 29.2 | 30        |

### 6. LOD/LOQ Validation
The Excel file for LOD/LOQ should contain blank measurements in a single column.

**Expected Structure for the LOD/LOQ File:**

| Blank |
|-------|
| x1    |
| ...   |
| xi    |

## Usage Instructions
1. **Check Each Excel File**: Ensure your Excel files are structured as per the examples provided above.
2. **Run the Script**: Once the files are prepared, import them into the script to perform the different validations.
3. **Analyze Results**: The script will generate reports detailing the results of the various analyses (linearity, accuracy, repeatability, robustness, exactitude profile, and LOD/LOQ).


## Download the Executable
You can download the compiled executable package (Windows) from the latest release: [Release v1.0.0](https://github.com/samibnz1/Analytical-Method-Validation-Interface/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  
The release contains a ZIP file (`ValidationTool-v1.0.0.zip`) with the executable, required DLLs, and example datasets. Extract the ZIP file and run `validation_tool.exe` directly.  
**Note**: Ensure your antivirus is up to date before running the executable. This tool has been developed as part of an academic project at FST FÃ¨s and is safe to use, but always exercise caution with executables from the internet.
